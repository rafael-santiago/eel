# Eel

``Eel`` is a acronym which means ``E``nigma's ``e``ngine ``l``ibrary.

It is about a *C* library that intends to help on abstracting ``Enigma machines`` implementations.

``Eel`` emulates the ``U-boat Enigma`` behavior, the enigma which was cracked by ``Alan Turing`` during the ``WWII``.

Of course that you should use it only for fun issues. In fact the ``Enigma`` machine nowadays is a
pencil-and-paper cipher. You should never protect sensible data with  the ``Enigma`` cipher.
Do not be naive.

Alternatively, ``Enigma`` has a strong historical value. Then here you can probe the library's source code
for looking inside the ``U-boat Enigma's`` entrails. For figuring out the problem imposed by this cipher
engine in the past and also for understanding how ``Rejewski & Turing Bombs`` worked in order to crack this
cipher. What shortened the war and saved millions of lives according to historians.
